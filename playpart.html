        <h6>KROGSTAD:</h6>
        <p>_[in the doorway]_.</p><p>I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?</p>

        <h6>MRS LINDE:</h6>
        <p>It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.</p>

        <h6>KROGSTAD:</h6>
        <p>Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p>

        <h6>MRS LINDE:</h6>
        <p>It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.</p>

        <h6>KROGSTAD:</h6>
        <p>_[coming into the room]_.</p><p> Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p>

        <h6>MRS LINDE:</h6>
        <p>Yes, why not?</p>

        <h6>KROGSTAD:</h6>
        <p>Certainly—why not?</p>

        <h6>MRS LINDE:</h6>
        <p>Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>

        <h6>KROGSTAD:</h6>
        <p>Can we two have anything to talk about?</p>

        <h6>MRS LINDE:</h6>
        <p>We have a great deal to talk about.</p>
        
        <h6>KROGSTAD:</h6>
        <p>I shouldn’t have thought so.</p>

        <h6>MRS LINDE:</h6>
        <p>No, you have never properly understood me.</p>
