        KROGSTAD:
        _[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?<br>

        MRS LINDE:
        It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.<br>

        KROGSTAD:
        Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?<br>

        MRS LINDE:
        It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.<br>

        KROGSTAD:
        _[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?<br>

        MRS LINDE:
        Yes, why not?<br>

        KROGSTAD:
        Certainly—why not?<br>

        MRS LINDE:
        Now, Nils, let us have a talk.<br>

        KROGSTAD:
        Can we two have anything to talk about?<br>

        MRS LINDE:
        We have a great deal to talk about.<br>

        KROGSTAD:
        I shouldn’t have thought so.<br>

        MRS LINDE:
        No, you have never properly understood me.<br>
