        <p class="speech">Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?

        <p><h4><p class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE</p></h4></p>
        <p class="speech">Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you believe that I did it with a light heart?</p>

        <p><h4><p class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD</p></h4></p>
        <p class="speech">Didn’t you?</p>

        <p><h4><p class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE</p></h4></p>
        <p class="speech">Nils, did you really think that?</p>

        <p><h4><p class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD</p></h4></p>
        <p class="speech">If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at the time?</p>

        <p><h4><p class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE</p></h4></p>
        <p class="speech">I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.</p>

        <p><h4><p class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD</p></h4></p>
        <p class="direction">_[wringing his hands]_.</p><p class="speech">So that was it. And all this—only for the sake of money!</p>

        <p><h4><p class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE</p></h4></p>
        <p class="speech">You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little brothers. We couldn’t wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed hopeless then.</p>
